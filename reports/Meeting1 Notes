Feature Engineering Ideas:
1. Do clustering on the Drug products to represent the general category
2. Predict the order probabilities
3. Do the features about the time


Collaboration:
1. Try different ideas and develop different models. Ensembling may be applied in the last step.
2. Have a pipeline to iterate for model eveluation


Random thoughts:
- What does each row mean?
- Identify the trend of products and possible complementary relationships between products
